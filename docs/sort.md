#### Sort
    This package consiste of simple to complex sort algorithms
    
    All function extend from root: el.
    
#### Functions
- _binarySort([ T, ]): [ T, ]_. nb: T = number | string. O(nlogn) in worse case.
- _insertionSort([ T, ]): [ T, ]_. nb: T = number | string. O(nlogn) in worse case and O(1/2 * n^2) on average.
- _mergeSort([ T, ]): [ T, ]_. nb: T = number | string. O(n^2) in worse case and O(nlogn) on average.
- _selectionSort([ T, ]): [ T, ]_. nb: T = number | string. O(n^2) in worse case.
- _shellSort([ T, ]): [ T, ]_. nb: T = number | string. O(n^2) in worse case and O(nlogn) on average.
